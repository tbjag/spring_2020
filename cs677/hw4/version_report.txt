completed first naive version. it uses the first for loop as all the threads. all interactions are through global memory. 
can do any size confirmed. made more dynamic. 
test with larger numbers
loop reorder is not possible because of the way we add rows


v2 - timer *
v3 - k_loop storage, bring into registers * all that i can for now?
v4 - make size dynamic & testing of large n & timing of c prog *
v5 - tiling shared mems
v6 - 2 kernel launches
v7 - const mem try both access structs
